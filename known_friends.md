| EDC Extension for Asset Administration Shell (AAS) | Asset Administration Shell (AAS) data can be manually shared over the EDC by linking an EDC Asset to the HTTP endpoint of the specific AAS element. Additionally, contracts and policies have to be defined for each element. In order to minimize configuration effort and prevent errors, this extension is able to link existing AAS services and its elements to the EDC automatically. Furthermore, this extension can also start an AAS service by reading an static AAS model file. A default contract and policy can be chosen to be applied for all elements. For critical elements, additional contracts and policies can be placed. External changes to the structure of an AAS are automatically synchronized by the extension. | [aas4edc@iosb.fraunhofer.de](mailto:aas4edc@iosb.fraunhofer.de) or [jens.mueller@iosb.fraunhofer.de](mailto:jens.mueller@iosb.fraunhofer.de) | [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/FraunhoferIOSB/EDC-Extension-for-AAS), [more information about AAS](https://www.plattform-i40.de/SiteGlobals/IP/Forms/Listen/Downloads/EN/Downloads_Formular.html?cl2Categories_TechnologieAnwendungsbereich_name=Verwaltungsschale)
