# Onboarding and first steps

This document serves as an entrypoint for new community members of the Eclipse Dataspace Components (EDC) project.
If you are not yet familiar with the EDC nomenclature, we strongly advise reading the
[documentation](https://eclipse-edc.github.io/docs/#/) and/or watching the
[introductory videos](https://www.youtube.com/@eclipsedataspaceconnector9622/featured).

## Samples

The [Samples repository](https://github.com/eclipse-edc/Samples) provides a set of examples for getting familiar with
the EDC framework and learning how to set up and use a connector. The samples begin with the very basics (e.g. learning
how to write an extension or use a configuration file) and then move on to more complex scenarios (e.g. performing
different data transfers). More samples will be added in the future, so be sure to check back regularly.
