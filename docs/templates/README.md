# Templates

Find all provided documentation templates in this folder. Please note that the cursive marked words 
and sentences should be removed. Feel free to add additional sections and subsections, however, make sure
that at least the not optionally marked sections of the templates are filled.

## Decision Records

[Link](decision-record.md) to template.

Each decision record should be located [here](../developer/decision-records) and provide a separate 
folder following a naming pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD-title-of-decision-record`. This contains all relevant 
files, at least a `README.md` that covers the filled template and, e.g., additional images.

## Extensions

[Link](extension.md) to template.

Every module located [here](../../extensions) has to provide documentation, e.g., about functionality, 
implementation, or architectural details.
The filled template has to be added as `README.md` to each module. Any additional files can be placed 
in a dedicated `docs` directory. As defined by the template, this markdown file can hint to submodules 
that provide the same documentation scope themselves.

## Launchers

[Link](launcher.md) to template.

Every module located [here](../../launchers) has to provide documentation about its purpose and usage.
The filled template has to be added as `README.md` to each module. Any additional files can be placed 
in a dedicated `docs` directory.
