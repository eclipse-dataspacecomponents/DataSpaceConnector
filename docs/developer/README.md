# Developer Documentation

As a developer, I want to ...
- ... extend the existing codebase.
- ... write new extensions.
- ... work on the service provider interface (SPI).
- ... improve core implementations.
- ... have clear requirements.
- ... add documentation to new and existing code.
- ... stick to existing coding styleguides.
- ... get an overview of past decision records.
- ... improve software tests.

As a developer, I do not want to ...
- ... bring in new requirements.
- ... deep-dive into use cases.
