# The `autodoc` Gradle plugin

Please find the comprehensive documentation about the `autodoc` plugin in
the [Github Repo](https://github.com/eclipse-dataspaceconnector/GradlePlugins/blob/main/docs/developer/autodoc.md) of
the plugin.

In EDC, the plugin is intended to be used to generate metamodel manifests for every Gradle module, which then
transformed into Markdown files, subsequently rendered for publication in static web content.
